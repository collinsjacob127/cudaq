    "## Shor's algorithm\n",
    "The factoring problem for an integer $N$ aims to find integers $a_1$, $a_2$ which are factors of $N$.  This problem is interesting when $N$ is not prime and the solutions $a_1$ and $a_2$ are non-trivial.  In other words, we will attempt to find integers $a_1$ and $a_2$ satisfying $N=a_1\\cdot a_2$ with $a_1\\neq 1$ and $a_2\\neq 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm consists of two ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduce the problem of factoring the integer $N$ to the order-finding problem.\n",
    "* Solve the order-finding problem: \n",
    "Given integers $a$ and $N$ so that $a$ and $N$ share no common factors (i.e., the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $N$ is 1), find the smallest positive integer which satisfies $a^r \\equiv 1 \\mod N$.  This value $r$ is refered to as the *order of* $a \\mod N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two ideas are combined in the following steps in Shor's algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Rule out the easy case that $N$ is even\n",
    "1. Select a random integer $a$ between $2$ and $N-1$\n",
    "2. Check to see if $a$ is a factor of $N$ (if so we're done!)\n",
    "3. Find the order of $a \\mod N$, (i.e., find $r$ so that $a^r\\equiv 1 \\mod N$)\n",
    "4. Check to see if $a^{\\frac{r}{2}}-1$ or $a^{\\frac{r}{2}}+1$ are integers and share common, non-trivial, divisors with $N$ (if so we're done!)\n",
    "5. If no factor is found, repeat steps 1 through 4 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `shors_algorithm` below outlines these steps for both the classical and the quantum implementation of Shor's algorithm. For the purposes of demonstration, we will also control the initial random integer selected in step 1 so that we can investigate cases in which the selected integer produces common divisors of $N$ in step 4 and others in which step 4 produces no common factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note about terminology:** Some literature refers to the \"period-finding problem\" in Shor's algorithm.  The order-finding problem, as we have described above, can be recast as finding the period of the function $f(x) = a^x\\mod N$, by noticing that the period of $f(x)$ is one more than the order of $a\\mod N$. The period finding problem is more general than the order-finding problem since it aims to find the period of any periodic function, not just modular exponentiation.\n"

    "While Shor's algorithm provably can factor numbers faster than known classical techniques, the resources required for implementing Shor's algorithm are hefty. A full-scale implementation to factor an $L$-bit number could require a quantum kernel with $5L+1$ qubits to achieve accuracy for the continued fractions part of the algoirthm and as many as $72L^3$ quantum gates for the modular exponentiaion [(Beckman, Chari, Devabhaktuni, & Preskill, 1996)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9602016).  Both of these are well beyond the capabilities of modern quantum hardware for numbers of interest. Advancements to reduce the number of gates and qubits required focus on optimizing the kernel for $f(x) = a\\cdot x \\mod N$ for properties of the number to be factored. The difficulty is to create efficient quantum kernels (in terms of qubit and gate count) that compute $a\\cdot x \\mod{N}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this demonstration, we will consider only the order-finding problem for the values of $a$ to be either $4$ or $5$ with $N=21$. We'll be using the quantum circuits depicted in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13855) and [this report](https://physlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shor_s_Algorithm_23100113_Fin.pdf), respectively. \n"
